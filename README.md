# Rustales
A text-based adventure game developed in Rust using the ncurses wrapper library. Unfortunately, the ncurses library is currently only compatible with unix-based systems. See their [github page](https://github.com/jeaye/ncurses-rs) for more information on installation, setup or compatibility. 


### Installation

Rustales requires [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) to run.

```
